# Multi-step Reservoir Storage Volume Forecasting Using Deep Learning
Multi-step reservoir forecasting approach based on a hybrid CNN-LSTM deep learning Encoder-Decoder algorithm. 
The proposed approach offers a three-month, weekly averaged prediction of reservoir storage volume based on historical snow water equivalent (SWE) during the runoff season from April through June each year.
